Here’s the complete list of **fully hardcoded, import-free Solidity files** we’ve created and aligned with your secure, DAO-governed, anti-rug-pull ecosystem architecture so far:

---

### ✅ **Core Token & Governance**

1. **`RHEMToken.sol`**  
   - Capped at 1 billion  
   - DAO + Timelock + Community wallet  
   - Fees: 0.5% Burn, 0.25% Dev  
   - Transfer, transferFrom, snapshot support  
   - Ownership renounced to DAO  
   - Security-enhanced (no mint, no rug, no scam)

2. **`Governance.sol`**  
   - DAO voting architecture  
   - Proposal creation, voting, quorum  
   - Snapshot-based anti-flash voting  
   - Tied to RHEM balances  
   - DAO-controlled upgrade & governance logic

3. **`RhesusMacaqueVoting.sol`**  
   - Voting executor contract  
   - Integrates with Governance  
   - Controls access to sensitive upgrades and features

4. **`TimelockVault.sol`**  
   - DAO-only LP/asset release  
   - Secure vault for governance-controlled delay  
   - Prevents instant rug-pull actions  
   - Time-based execution of proposals

---

### ✅ **Liquidity Management**

5. **`LiquidityLocker.sol`**  
   - DAO-controlled DEX liquidity locker  
   - Prevents premature withdrawal  
   - Emits `LockDeleted`, full tracking  
   - Immutable unlock time  
   - Protection against token drain or mismanagement

---

### ✅ **NFT System (DAO-Based)**

6. **`NFTMarketplace.sol`**  
   - Fully embedded ERC721 NFT Marketplace  
   - DAO-set listing/sale fees (0.5% burn, 0.25% dev)  
   - Allows minting, listing, unlisting, buying  
   - Events for full transparency  
   - RHEM-based transactions  
   - Staking/fee logic inline

7. **`CustomNFT.sol`** *(ERC721 Core)*  
   - Hardcoded ERC721 logic  
   - DAO minting rights  
   - Metadata handling  
   - Bridging/staking compatibility  
   - No external imports or reliance

---

### ✅ **Advanced Utilities (New)**

8. **`NFTStaking.sol`**  
   - Users stake NFTs to earn RHEM rewards  
   - DAO reward pool  
   - Claim logic  
   - Security: only real NFTs, anti-manipulation logic

9. **`NFTBridge.sol`**  
   - NFT bridging across chains (BSC-ready)  
   - Lock/mint pattern  
   - DAO-controlled bridge nodes  
   - Events for transparency  
   - Future support for cross-chain deployments

Let me know if you'd like any of these re-printed, renamed, grouped for Remix testing, or zipped up for local use. Ready to assist with deployment prep too!
